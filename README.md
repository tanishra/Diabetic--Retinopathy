## Description

This project develops a machine learning model to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in retinal images, 
categorizing them into five severity levels: No DR, Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, and Proliferative DR.
A web application is created using Streamlit, allowing users to upload retinal images and receive real-time 
predictions with confidence scores for each category. This project highlights the application of deep learning 
in healthcare and aims to enhance early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.


## What is Diabetic Retinopathy ?

Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye condition that occurs when high blood sugar levels damage
the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision impairment and potential blindness.

Types (Labels):
No Diabetic Retinopathy (No DR)
Mild Diabetic Retinopathy (Mild DR)
Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy (Moderate DR)
Severe Diabetic Retinopathy (Severe DR)
Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (Proliferative DR)
